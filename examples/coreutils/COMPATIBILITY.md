# GNU coreutils compatibility

The behavioral target is the locally installed GNU coreutils 9.11. Option
names and contracts come from the matching files in `/usr/share/man/man1` and
the installed `--help` output. Tests compare MLX executables directly with
their `/usr/bin` counterparts.

## Implemented utilities

| Utility | Option surface | Remaining semantic work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `true`, `false` | complete | none known |
| `echo` | complete | locale-specific XSI behavior is not enabled |
| `cat` | complete | validate multibyte display behavior outside `LC_ALL=C` |
| `wc` | complete | full Unicode `wcwidth` and hardware-specific `--debug` wording |
| `pwd` | complete | none known |
| `mkdir` | complete | native context assignment still needs validation on an SELinux/SMACK host |
| `rmdir` | complete | none known |
| `basename`, `dirname` | complete | none known |
| `head` | complete | bounded-memory streaming for negative counts |
| `tail` | complete | inotify, multiple followed files, and repeated `--pid` values currently use reduced polling behavior |
| `tee` | complete | validate rare non-EPIPE device failures for every output-error mode |
| `yes` | complete | none known |
| `sleep` | complete | GNU infinity and scientific-number extensions |
| `uname` | complete | platform/processor discovery where the kernel reports extra values |
| `printenv` | complete | none known |
| `env` | complete | full FreeBSD `-S` expansion grammar and inherited signal-state detail |
| `nproc` | complete | OpenMP thread-limit environment extensions |
| `link`, `unlink` | complete | none known |
| `touch` | complete | full GNU natural-language dates and non-UTC local timezone rules |
| `truncate` | complete | validate filesystem-specific IO-block behavior |
| `mkfifo` | complete | native context assignment still needs validation on an SELinux/SMACK host |
| `sync` | complete | none known |
| `cp` | partial | recursive trees, symlink policies, backups, sparse/reflink copies, ownership, xattrs, ACLs, and interactive mode |

“Complete” means the documented option surface is implemented and covered by
the current parity suite. It does not claim locale, filesystem, or kernel
behaviors that cannot be exercised on the development host.

## Utilities not implemented yet

The installed GNU 9.11 suite contains 103 command names. Implementation now
proceeds through the remaining filesystem tools (`mv`, `rm`, `ln`, `chmod`,
`chown`, `stat`, `readlink`, `realpath`, `ls`), then
text/data tools, checksums, and the remaining system/account utilities.
